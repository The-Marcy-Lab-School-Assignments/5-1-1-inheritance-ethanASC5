# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

I dont have the best definition for polymorphism but from what I remember it is a fancy way to say that different objects can be treated as instances of the same class, even if they are actually from different classes.


```js 

class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("The dog barks");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("The cat meows");
  }
}

function makeAnimalSpeak(animal) {
  animal.speak();
}
```

Your example is great! Polymorphism is directly correlated to inheritance where two related classes can have the same method but the implementation or behavior is different!
