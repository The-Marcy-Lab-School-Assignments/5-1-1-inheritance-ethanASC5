# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
There are 2 main differences between an `instance` method and a `class` method. The difference is how they are acessesed and defined. An instance method is defined without the `static` keyword. To access an instance method create an instance of the class and then call the method on that instance. A class` method is the opposite it is defined using the static keyword. To access a class method, you call it directly on the class, not on an instance of the class. Instsnces are tied to a spacific class while `class` methods are tied to the class itself.
